# Challenge-1
## Horiseon Semantic Challenge

### Description
In this challenge, I had to change all div elements in the HTML file to the correct corresponding semantic elements and changed the CSS file to match. For example, I changed the div element under the header tag to nav. In order to get the entire work properly, I had to also change the div in the CSS file to nav so the HTML would reference the correct styling format. I also consolidate redundant class elements in both the HTML and CSS files to make the code easier to follow and understand. I also added the alt attribute to the image files.
